INSPIRATION
Imagine being a property owner in Kenya, struggling to find a reliable platform to list your rental properties.
That was the spark behind KHEJAS. Frustrated by the lack of specialized platforms catering to the unique needs of property owners and Long-term clients in Kenya, 
I envisioned a solution that would not only fill this gap but also ensure accessibility.
